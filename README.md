Project Name: Guess my Number!

Description:
The app will choose a random number between a given range. The user will have to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly then the app will pick a random number again for the user to guess. This continues as long as the user keeps getting it right. The app keeps track of how many times the user got the number right in a row. If the user gets a number wrong, the app shows their record of correct guesses.

Leaderboard system that saves data even when the app is closed
Multiple difficulty settings
